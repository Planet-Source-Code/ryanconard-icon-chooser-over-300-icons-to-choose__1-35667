Hey everyone..



Ok.. heres the dilly...
========================

This program took ALOT of time to do.. even though its on 17% done..so if you want more of this program then you gotta vote! I want ATLEAST 5 excellent votes to continue making, because if i dont get atleast 5 excellent votes then ill know that no one cares about this program..

Second
=========


If you are having program either loading or viewing icons, then please email me at rconard@localnet.com - Everything SHOULD work if you extract the program to the correct path..

I think the path has to be: "C:\Windows\Profiles\Ryan\Desktop\ICONS"

If thats the case then im very sorry for the inconvenience, but i have multiple users on my computer so thats why winzip does it like that...


ENJOY!!!
